# Unleash the power of collaboration with open source

For us, as the long-time experts in vehicle base software, middleware, development tools, cloud-based operations services, cybersecurity solutions, and end-to-end engineering and consulting services, Enabling Tomorrow's Automotive Software really means sparking collaboration and thereby innovation with Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in a vibrant community.

Interested in what that exactly means to us as ETAS? Take a look at our official [ðŸ’™ FOSS Manifesto ðŸ’™](https://www.etas.com/en/open-source-software.php)!
